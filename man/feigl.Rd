\title{Leukaemia survival times --- Feigl \& Zelen}
\description{
  The file  contains the
  survival times  in weeks of 33 patients
  suffering from acute myelogeneous leukaemia, and the values of two
  explanatory variables, white blood cell count  in thousands
  and a positive or negative factor , positive values  being defined by
  the presence of Auer rods and/or significant
  granulature of the leukaemic cells in the bone marrow at diagnosis,
  and negative values if both Auer rods and granulature are
  absent.
