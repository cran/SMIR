\title{Remission times of acute leukemia patients --- Gehan et al}
\description{Data from a clinical trial which compared  6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) to a placebo in
  the maintenance of remissions in acute leukemia. The remission times
  in weeks one year after the start of the study were
  recorded. Participants were paired according to remission status, an
  aspect not described in Gehan (1965).
